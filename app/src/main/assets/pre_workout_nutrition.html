We recommend that you have a light snack before working out so that you are able to push yourself to the max during the workout. Your goal during the workout should be to raise your heart rate during exercise to increase body&rsquo;s metabolism and to keep it elevated even after the workout. Short bursts of intense workouts (High Intensity Interval Training or HIIT Workouts) achieve this very effectively. All our workouts are designed to be HIIT workouts to achieve best results.</span>
