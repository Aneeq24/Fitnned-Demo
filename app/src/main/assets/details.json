    "detail": "<h3>Steps:</h3> <ol> <li>Lie on an exercise ball with your lower back curvature pressed against the spherical surface of the ball. Your feet should be bent at the knee and pressed firmly against the floor. The upper torso should be hanging off the top of the ball. The arms should either be kept alongside the body or crossed on top of your chest as these positions avoid neck strains (as opposed to the hands behind the back of the head position). <li>Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position. <li>With the hips stationary, flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second. <li>As you inhale, go back to the starting position. <li>Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. </ol> <h3>Variations:</h3> You can perform this exercise with a low pulley behind you with a rope attached on its end. In this manner you can go ahead and add resistance easier. For this variation, you will need to hold on to the sides of the rope throughout the movement. I like to bring my arms forward to the point that the upper arms are almost parallel to my torso and the lower arms are facing back holding the rope. <h3>Caution:</h3> Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough on your hands learning how to balance yourself. Also, if balance is an issue I recommend having a spotter next to you and also placing each of your feet under a 100-lb dumbbell for added stability.<br> As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell or a weight plate (held at arms length) on top of your chest. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise, because if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia."

    "detail": "<h3>Steps:</h3> In strength training and fitness, the squat is a compound, full body exercise that trains primarily the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, quadriceps (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and rectus femoris), hamstrings, as well as strengthening the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the legs and buttocks, as well as developing core strength. Isometrically, the lower back, the upper back, the abdominals, the trunk muscles, the costal muscles, and the shoulders and arms are all essential to the exercise and thus are trained when squatting with the proper form.<br><br><h3>Steps:</h3><ol><li> Stand with feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart, hips stacked over knees, and knees over ankles.<li>  Roll the shoulders back and down away from the ears. Note: Allowing the back to round (like a turtleâ€™s shell) will cause unnecessary stress on the lower back. It's important to maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.<li> comfortable, pull elbows close to the body, palms facing each other and thumbs pointing up.<li>  Initiate the movement by inhaling and unlocking the hips, slightly bringing them back. Keep sending hips backward as the knees begin to bend.<li>  While the butt starts to stick out, make sure the chest and shoulders stay upright, and the back stays straight. Keep the head facing forward with eyes straight ahead for a neutral spine.<li>  The best squats are the deepest ones your mobility allows. Optimal squat depth would be your hips sinking below the knees (again, if you have the flexibility to do so comfortably). Pro tip: Squatting onto a box until the butt gently taps it will be a reminder to squat low.<li>  Engage core and, with bodyweight in the heels, explode back up to standing, driving through heels. Imagine the feet are spreading the floor (left foot to the left, right foot to the right) without actually moving the feet.</ol><h3>Caution:</h3> This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.<br><h3>Variations:</h3> This can be performed with dumbbells, weights and barbells"

    "detail": "<h3>Steps:</h3><ol><li>This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level. <li>Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.<li>Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.<li>Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).<li>Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.<li>Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.<li>Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</ol><h3>Caution: </h3>This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly."

    "detail": "<h3>Steps:</h3> <ol> <li>Sit down on a bench with back suppport and grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it overhead at arms length. Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position.</li><li>Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Brath in as you perform this step.</li><li>Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breath out as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><h3>Variations:</h3><li> You can perform this exercise standing as well but this puts strain on your back especially if you are using heavy dummbbells like 95 lbs or so.</li><li> Another variation is to use a EX or straight bar instead in which case your will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip). There is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise.</li><li>. Finally, a low pulley cable with a rope attachment or bar (straight or EZ) attachment at the end can be used for variety purposes as well.</li>"
